To create a graphical application in C# programming language that displays the value of a car of a given model and make. The value is determined by adding to the value of the base model an additional amount for the extras that are specified in the application form.
An example appearance of the application is shown above. The make and model of the car is selected using a radio button, and the photo of the car is also changed during selection.
In the "Base configuration - parameters" group box, the parameters of the base model (engine, power, gearbox, fuel and number of doors) are indicated.
Additional extras are selected with check boxes and the selected ones are added to the final price after pressing the "Calculate" button.
The "Clear" button resets the form to its initial state (one of the base price car models is selected and all extras are deselected).
The "End" button exits the application.
All data is exemplary and serves for orientation only. The main requirements are:
 At least three radio buttons
 Minimum 4 checkboxes
 Minimum 5 parameters of the base model
 Name of the application, both in the form itself and in the title line.
 Application icon other than the standard one in the title bar
 Three event management buttons The final price should be in BGN and formatted as shown in the figure.
